NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database
---------------------------------------

The NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database [#f1]_ [#f2]_ (PAHdb hereafter)
hosts the world's foremost collection of infrared (IR) PAH
spectra. PAHdb's spectral libraries contain over 4,000 laboratory
measured and quantum chemically computed PAH spectra. Beyond
spectroscopic data, PAHdb also provides software tools to work with
the spectral data. The portal to the data and tools is the PAHdb
website, which is located at `https://www.astrochemistry.org/pahdb
<https://www.astrochemistry.org/pahdb>`_. This is the manual for the
AmesPAHdbPythonSuite and describes its features and capabilities.

Please consult the `website <https://www.astrochemistry.org/pahdb>`_
for additional resources and information, and the PAHdb
`cookbook <https://pahdb.github.io/cookbook/>`_ for general usage and examples.
