 Graphical User Interface
=========================
         
Utilizing IDL's widget programming capabilities, a simple
graphical user interface (GUI) is available to explore the
contents of a database XML-file. The GUI provides an overview of
the embedded PAH species and the fundamental vibrational
transitions - both tabulated and graphically, and 3D-rotatable
chemical structure of the selected species. A database XML-file
can be loaded through the 'Fileâ†’Open' menu-option.

**NB** The GUI generates all necessary assets on-the-fly, which
results in a considerable start-up-time, notably when loading a
large database.
